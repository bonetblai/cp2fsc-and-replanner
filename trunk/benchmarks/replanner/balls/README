An agent traverses a grid looking for different types of balls.

Versions:

- colored: the balls have colors. The position and color of the
    balls is unknown to the agent. The balls must be delivered
    to different spots depending on the color of the ball.

- uncolored: the balls have no colors. The task is to locate and
    pick up the balls.
