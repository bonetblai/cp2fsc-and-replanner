        Axioms must be translated into rules for completing the
        hidden initial state

[DONE]  Invariants must also be generated from axioms

        Remove unnecessary trivial invariants p => p. For this,
        may need to introduce (unknown ?p) constructs and revise
        preprocessing step

        Optimize grounding of formulas as it is taking too much
        time, the problem is the repeatedly grounding of same
        formula, which implies a to_string() call when computing
        the value of static atoms at initial state.
