* Revision before action compilation and preprocessing is 233
* test and fix all benchmark problems with respect naming of elements.
* revise compute_static_atoms in preprocessing for cp2fsc.

* Revision before general translation is 255

* Restore 'delete reader' in k-replanner.cc
* Complete initial hidden state w/ fix point of inference rules
* Provide functionality to select hidden states with indices to solve

* Proposal for principled handling of active sensing:

General translation is a 3-stage process:

Problem w/ multi                                       K-replanner instance
values vars and   ==>  Propositional translation  ==>  with pasive sensing
active sensing

Syntax for multi-valued description is still pending.

Syntax for propositional translation given by:

1) Variables and observable variables specified with
   (variable ...) and (obs-variable) in :init

2) All actions of the form:

      Precondition
      Effects that include effects of the form C_i => Z(Y=y)
      Observables Z(Y=y)
 
   where different formulas W_a(Y=y) = C_1 v ... v C_n in DNF
   make up the sensing model for all the observable literals Y=y,
   and Z(Y=y) are atoms that "propositionalise" the obsevables.
   This observables must then appear in :init as

      (obs-variable Z(Y=y1) Z(Y=y2) ... Z(Y=yn))

3) Nothing else.
