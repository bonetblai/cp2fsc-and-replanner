* implement simplification of invariants in order to achieve the same
performance of old version of localize with new version of localize. 
The problem here is that the invariants are not simplified with the
known static atoms before generating the inference rules. To do this
right, we should compute static atoms with respect the p.o. problem
and the kp problem. The invariants are then filtered with the p.o.-
static atoms.

* implement the action completion preprocessing. Need to check definition
and do implementation.

* must enforce elements for each class of problems (cp2fsc or replanner)
so that there is no mixing.

* test and fix all benchmark problems with respect naming of elements.
