- CSP code needs to be revised:
    - AC3 looks inefficient in several aspects
    - CSP/AC3 needs to be fully separated from LW1, perhaps creating a middle layer [done]

- Inference code needs to be revised

- Check whether lw1:boost:compile-static-observables is really deprecated and
  whether something can be done about it

- type5 sensing drules are not currently generated. Check this.

- lw1:inference:forward-chaining is broken for lw1:strict. It appears to
  be working for lw1:aaai

- check whether k-replanner is still working
