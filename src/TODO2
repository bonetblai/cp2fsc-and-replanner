* Axioms must be translated into invariants and rules
  for completing the hidden initial state

* Remove unnecessary trivial invariants p => p. For this,
  may need to introduce (unknown ?p) constructs and revise
  preprocessing step

* Optimize grounding of formulas as it is taking too much
  time, the problem is the repeatedly grounding of same
  formula, which implies a to_string() call when computing
  the value of static atoms at initial state.
