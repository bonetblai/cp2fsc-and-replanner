Different versions of the wumpus domain.

Versions:

- short: a simplified version of the game with only
    wumpuses, and where the goal is to reach a goal
    position from a known initial position. The challenge
    is to navigate safely through the gridworld.

- diagonal: a simplified version in which the wumpus
    are placed around the main diagonal that goes from
    cell (1,1) to cell (n,n). In such a grid, there
    are n-2 wumpues, each one above or below the
    main diagonal. This version is designed in order 
    to compare with other algorithms.

- full: version of the game without shooting arrows.
    There can be pits/wumpus at each cell. The agent
    must navigate in a safe manner inside the cave
    to grab the gold.

- kill: there is a single wumpus in the grid that must
    be killed by the agent when next to it. The agent
    must navigate and locate the wumpus, and then kill
    it.
