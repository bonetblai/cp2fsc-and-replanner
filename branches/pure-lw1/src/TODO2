[DONE]  Axioms must be used to complete the hidden initial states

[DONE]  Invariants must also be generated from axioms

        Remove unnecessary trivial invariants p => p. For this,
        may need to introduce (unknown ?p) constructs and revise
        preprocessing step

[DONE]  Optimize grounding of formulas as it is taking too much
        time, the problem is the repeatedly grounding of same
        formula, which implies a to_string() call when computing
        the value of static atoms at initial state.

        Check detection/handling of static fluents in preprocessing.
