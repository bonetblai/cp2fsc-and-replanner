There is no way for planner to make assumption of obs0 at given position.

- Type4 rules allows the planner to simulate obs0 but dnf for other observations
are added as clauses and planner cannot derive anything 

- Type5 rules go in the other direction allowing the planner to derive obsK literals

- Type3 rules permit derivation of literals once obsK rules are present

Need way for planner to assume a result like obs0 literal when lw1:literals-for-observables
are active
