#summary Introduction to wiki for cp2fsc & K-Replanner.

= Introduction =

This wiki documents the cp2fsc and K-Replanner software for planning with sensing. Cp2fsc is a software tool aimed at the synthesis of a general _finite-state controllers_ (FSCs) that prescribe the next action to execute after an observed sequence of actions/observations pairs for a control problem. The FSC is guaranteed to work for all possible trajectories of the control problem and it often generalizes for other similar control problems or when actions are non-deterministic. On the other hand, K-Replanner is an on-line planning tool aimed at computing a _single execution_ trajectory that ends in a goal state for planning problems with sensing. K-Replanner is always sound and it is complete for a well-defined and broad class of planning problems. Both tools are based on a common planning framework, yet they are aimed at different types of problems, deliver different types of results, and have different guarantees.
