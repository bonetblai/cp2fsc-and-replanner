= Planning and Control Problems =

The model from which finite-state controllers are derived stands for a class of contingent planning problems. For problems in this class, we make three assumptions. First, that actions are deterministic and thus all uncertainty results from incomplete information in the initial situation. Second, that actions may have conditional effects but no preconditions, and thus are always executable. And third, that sensing is passive meaning that the set of observable fluents is fixed and does not depend on the action taken. The contingent planning problem remains challenging even under these assumptions, and in particular, the controllers that we obtain from these models often work when the assumption of determinism is dropped.

Under these assumptions, we adopt a syntax for expressing contingent problems similar to the one used for defining classical problems P=(F,I,A,G), where F is the set of fluents, I and G stand for the initial and goal situations, and A is the set of actions, except for the following features.

Actions a in A have all empty preconditions but may have a number of conditional effects C → C, where C is a set of fluent literals and C is either one such set or one such literal. We sometimes write them as a : C → C when we want to indicate the action name.

The initial situation I is given by a set of clauses over the fluents in F so the possible initial states are the truth valuations over F that satisfy I.

A set D of axioms or ramification rules r ⇐ C are used to define a set of _non-primitive fluents_ r ∈ R, where C is a set of literals defined over the _primitive fluents_ in F (Thi&eacute;baux, Hoffmann, and Nebel 2005). The sets R and F are disjoint, and we allow non-primitive fluents in the body C of conditional effects C → C and goals, but we do not allow them in the heads C.

A state s is a truth valuation over the primitive fluents that defines the truth value of the non-primitive fluents r ∈ R through the axioms:

  * r is true in s iff there is an axiom r ⇐ C such that C is true in s.

The observable fluents or simply the observables refer to
a set O ⊆ R of non-primitive fluents whose truth value in a
given state s is known to the agent. An observation o represents
the conjunction of O-literals that are true in a given
state. We refer to the observation that corresponds to the
state s as o(s) and to the set of all possible observations as
O∗. Clearly, the size of O∗ is exponential in the number
of observable fluents. The observables along with the set
of axioms defining them constitute what is called the sensor
model, that relates the true but hidden state s with the
information o(s) available to the agent.
