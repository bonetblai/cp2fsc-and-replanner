For binary-search and classical-planner-based AS, we need to disable:

lw1:boost:enable-post-actions

The resason for this is that drule-sensing- actions are not preconditioned with last-action atoms
and thus they can be used to assert any atom of the form (K_not_secret p?). Therefore, after any
test-p? action, there are rules to infer the secret. The system then loops forever as the classical
plans always look the same.

lw1:boost:drule:sensing:type3

When this flag is enabled, clauses are generated for such rules (prefixed by CLAUSE3 when printed
by turning DEBUG on in lw1_problem.cc). These clauses permit incorrect inferences at the belief
tracking level. As pointed out in comments in lw1_problem.cc, I'm not sure why and how these clasues
got into the code. Are they really needed?
