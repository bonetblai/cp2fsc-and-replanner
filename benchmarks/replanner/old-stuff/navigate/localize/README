An agent must navigate a rectangular grid from a *unknown*
initial position to a goal position.  Some of the cells
represents walls (obstacles) and thus cannot be traversed.
These cells are known to the agent and in this case are
always the inner cells for the even-numbered rows; the
first row is numbered 1.  The agent senses the surrounding
walls at each time.
