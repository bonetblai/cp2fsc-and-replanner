A logistics domain where objects (packages) are moved using
trucks and airplanes. An object can be either at a location,
at an airport, inside a truck, or inside an airplane. Trucks
only move between locations belonging to the same city, while
airplanes move between airports.

Sensing reports information about the whether an object is at
a certain location, and whether an object is at certain 
airport.

There are two formulations of the domain, both working with
the same problem description. Formulation d1.pddl is more
verbose and strictly adheres to the LW1 specification.
Formulation d2.pddl is more efficient and relaxes the LW1
specification. For this problem, d2.pddl is sufficient.
