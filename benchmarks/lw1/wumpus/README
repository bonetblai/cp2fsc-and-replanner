There are two versions of this domain. In the first
version, named -1f and -2f, the agent navigates an
environment with wumpuses and pits (only for -1f)
looking for a piece of gold. In the second version,
the agent needs to reach the upper right corner of
the grid while avoiding the deadly wumpuses.
