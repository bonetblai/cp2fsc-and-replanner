Variable groups are not working in this case:

1. First tried to add variable groups only to domain 
but then, since there are sensing models for all the
cells, the relevant sensing literals could not be
assigned to groups. For example, (stench p7-5) that
should be mapped to vgroup-5, containing wumpus-4
and wumpus-5, is not done because (stench p7-5)
also depends on the literal (wumpus p7-4) which
is assigned to no group/variable.

2. To fix above issue, a new problem was created
where the (adj ?p ?q) relation is only restricted
to pairs involving potential locations for wumpus.
However, then we got that sensing litearls with
empty beam were mapped to arbitrary groups.

3. Fix above by requiring non empty beam for 
sensing literals when doing the map

commit 2d0347cb3b45b79cfe7902a22cd686eb1dc18046

4. Once the fix was in place, got a new error.
A segmentation fault without assertion violation.
Problem was in inference_engine.h when processing
an empty dnf (comming from last issue). Remove
segfault with fix

commit 56fa0145455ec7fd92cbfa89f5d4bd245b441f1a

5. The problem remains unsolvable with messages:

error: no action is applicable at current state:
unable to solve problem: error during action/plan computation
