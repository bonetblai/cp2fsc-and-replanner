An agent needs to pick up and dispose colored balls
placed on a grid. The position and color of the balls
are unknown to the agent. Depending on the color, 
the balls are disposed in different bins.

There are different formulations of the problem. The
most efficient, though not adhering to the strict 
LW1 specification is d2.pddl (used together with 
problem p1.pddl). The strict specification is in
d.pddl. Problems p.pddl and p1.pddl can be used
with both specifications, yet p1.pddl is preferred.
